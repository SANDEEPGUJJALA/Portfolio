										<h2><a href="#">Data Exploration of Insurance Dataset using SQL<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Banner insurance.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The primary goal of this project was to analyse an insurance dataset to uncover valuable insights about customer demographics, policy performance, vehicle characteristics, and the effectiveness of sales channels. By leveraging SQL queries, we aimed to explore key aspects of the insurance data and gain a better understanding of customer behaviour, policy adoption, and premium distribution. The data analysis focused on investigating patterns in customer engagement, vehicle damage history, and the relationship between customer demographics and their insurance-related decisions.
										The dataset included information about customer age, gender, driving license status, region codes, prior insurance, vehicle age and damage, annual premium amounts, and response rates. The analysis was carried out using MySQL queries to extract insights into customer segmentation, sales channel performance, and factors affecting insurance policy adoption.</p>
